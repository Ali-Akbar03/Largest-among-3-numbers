# Largest-among-3-numbers
Explanation:
Input Gathering:
The program prompts the user to enter three numbers using System.out.print.
The Scanner object is used to capture the user input for the three numbers.
Finding the Largest Number:
The program calls the findLargest method, which takes the three integers as parameters.
Inside the method, a series of conditional statements (if and else if) compares the values and returns the largest number.
Output:
The largest number is then printed to the console using System.out.println.
Closing the Scanner:
The scanner.close() statement is used to close the Scanner object, which is a good practice to prevent resource leaks.
